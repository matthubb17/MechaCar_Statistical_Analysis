# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Project Overview:

The goal of this project was to use R to build a statistical analysis of MechaCar vehicles and compare them to competitors.

## Resources:

**Main Challenge File:** [MechaCarChallenge](https://github.com/matthubb17/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/MechaCarChallenge.RScript.R)

**Software:** RStudio and R


## Linear Regression to Predict MPG:

The figure above shows the summary of the linerar regression for the MecaCar mgp.

*	Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
	*	When taking a look at the variables/coefficients. The vehicle length and the vehicle ground clearance are most likely to provide non-random amounts of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. Conversely, the vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and the AWD indicate a random amount of variance due to the p-values.  
*	Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
	*	The slope would be condidered as zero since it is a very small decimal.  
*	Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
	* The linear model has a r^2 value of 0.7149. This means that roughly 71% of all mpg predictions will be determined by this model. In summation, this model does predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.
